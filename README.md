# Cardio Data Simulator

The Cardio Data Simulator is a Java-based application designed to simulate real-time cardiovascular data for multiple patients. This tool is particularly useful for educational purposes, enabling students to interact with real-time data streams of ECG, blood pressure, blood saturation, and other cardiovascular signals.

## Features

- Simulate real-time ECG, blood pressure, blood saturation, and blood levels data.
- Supports multiple output strategies:
  - Console output for direct observation.
  - File output for data persistence.
  - WebSocket and TCP output for networked data streaming.
- Configurable patient count and data generation rate.
- Randomized patient ID assignment for simulated data diversity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or newer.
- Maven for managing dependencies and compiling the application.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tpepels/signal_project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd signal_project
   ```

3. Compile and package the application using Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean package
   ```
   This step compiles the source code and packages the application into an executable JAR file located in the `target/` directory.

### Running the Simulator

After packaging, you can run the simulator directly from the executable JAR:

```sh
java -jar target/cardio_generator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To run with specific options (e.g., to set the patient count and choose an output strategy):

```sh
java -jar target/cardio_generator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --patient-count 100 --output file:./output
```

### Supported Output Options

- `console`: Directly prints the simulated data to the console.
- `file:<directory>`: Saves the simulated data to files within the specified directory.
- `websocket:<port>`: Streams the simulated data to WebSocket clients connected to the specified port.
- `tcp:<port>`: Streams the simulated data to TCP clients connected to the specified port.

## UML Models

This project includes UML class diagrams for each major subsystem of the CHMS (Connected Healthcare Monitoring System). These diagrams represent the design structure, class responsibilities, and relationships between key components.

The following subsystems are modeled:
- Alert Generation System
- Data Storage System
- Patient Identification System
- Data Access Layer

You can find all the UML diagrams along with their design explanations in the file:[ UMLDiagrams.pdf](./src/main/uml%20diagrams/UMLDiagrams.pdf)

Note:The colleague Octavian had issues with vscode and maybe changed the nickname for when he is pushing on GitHub, from Octavian to ciulik(Ciulei Ionut Octavian), so it is the same user, just a different nickname.
